# Magazine Rack

This repo has files for my magazine rack project. 

It includes a model file that can be opened with tinkercad as well as some hand drawn dimensions.

To use Tinkercad is free, you just setup an account with AutoDesk at [https://www.tinkercad.com/](https://www.tinkercad.com/dashboard).

This also goes along with my companion video: [Woodworking: Building a Magazine Rack](https://youtu.be/YG3fnEQzTfU).
